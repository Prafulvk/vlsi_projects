**HI!** 

# VLSI Design & Verification Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository documents my learning journey in **VLSI Design and Verification**, covering **Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM**.  
The repo is structured as a collection of small projects, starting from **basic digital design** to **advanced verification environments**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Highlights

### 1. [4-bit ALU Design](./01-combinational-logic/alu)
- **Objective:** Designed a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with add, subtract, AND, OR.  
- **Verification:** Directed + Random testbench.  
- **Result:** Successfully verified functionality, added waveform screenshots.  
- ![ALU Waveform](./docs/alu_waveform.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Each project folder contains:
  - `src/` â€“ RTL design  
  - `tb/` â€“ Testbench files  
  - `scripts/` â€“ Simulation run scripts  
  - `README.md` â€“ Explanation of design & results  

---

## âœ¨ Future Plans
- Add **coverage-driven verification**.  
- Experiment with **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)**.  
- Try open-source synthesis (Yosys).
